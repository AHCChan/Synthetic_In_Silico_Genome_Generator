INSTRUCTIONS

To manually test the SISGG code, open up the Testing_Commands.txt document and use the commands.
    * Use them one by one, in either Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac).
    * Use them from inside the Testing_Before directory.

Compare the newly created files with the files in the Testing_After folder. If the code works, the files should be the same.



CAVEATS

You may need to modify the Python path in accordance with your own machine's specifications. (Or simply call Python if the appropriate modifications have been made to System Path.)

The output of Random Chromosome generator:
    * F001__Chr_Sizes (folder)
    * F002__Random_Chromosomes
... can only be used as a reference and not in a 1-for-1 comparison since the chromosomes generated are random and will be different every time.



FEEDBACK

Feel free to contact Angelo Chan (angelo.hoi.chung.chan@gmail.com) if you have any questions, feedback, or bugs to report.

Note that the testing process was designed this way to maximize accessibility and minimize dependencies.
